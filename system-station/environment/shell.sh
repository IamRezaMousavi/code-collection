# A shell is a computer program that exposes an operating system's services
# to a human user or other programs. In general, operating system shells
# use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI),
# depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell
# because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.
